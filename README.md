# You want to be millionaire or not?

This is a redevelopment of my first project with General Assembly, where i developed a browser based game using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
I decided to redo it using React and Typescript, to learn more about typescript development

## Main things to work on
- Landing page / Home page
- Instructions page
- volume toggle / slider
- game start (Q1)
- Displaying questions properly
- Randomise the answers button
- wrong answer -> losing page -> back to home page
- correct answer -> moving on page -> choose to take money and leave, or go to next question
- safety nets
- final question correct -> Winner page -> back to home

## Things to consider
- styling (Tailwindcss or other UI Librarires)
- Testing? try using Jest?
- How to use React Native?
- using Figma for mockups?
